What my main.py file does :

1)  Finds all game directories from /data
2)  Creates a new /games directory 
3)  Copies and removes the "game" suffix of all games into the /games directory
4)  Creates a .json file with the information about the games
5)  Compiles all of the game code 
6)  Runs all of the game code.
